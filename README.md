# FastAPI Sync-Async Starter

A modern Python web application template built with FastAPI, demonstrating sync vs async operations using SQLAlchemy 2.0, psycopg2, and asyncpg. Features comprehensive testing with pytest-asyncio and pytest-cov, plus Pydantic v2 for type safety.

## Features

- **FastAPI Framework Integration**
  - Modern Python web framework with automatic OpenAPI documentation
  - Built-in Swagger UI and ReDoc interfaces
  - High-performance ASGI server with uvicorn

- **Database Layer**
  - Dual database access patterns with `psycopg2` (sync) and `asyncpg` (async)
  - SQLAlchemy 2.0+ ORM with both sync and async session management
  - Type-safe database operations and model relationships
  - Structured database schema management

- **Testing Infrastructure**
  - Comprehensive test suite using `pytest`
  - Async endpoint testing with `pytest-asyncio`
  - Code coverage reporting with `pytest-cov`
  - HTML test reports via `pytest-html`
  - Database fixtures and test data management

- **Production Features**
  - CORS middleware configuration
  - Type validation with Pydantic v2
  - Clean and scalable project structure

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL database
- Poetry 2.1.1 (Python package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ysskrishna/fastapi-sync-async-starter
cd fastapi-sync-async-starter
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment using Poetry:
```bash
# Install dependencies and create virtual environment
poetry install
```


## Running the Application

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
poetry run python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### API Documentation
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive test suite using pytest. Here are the different ways to run tests:

### Run all tests
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

### Run tests with cleared cache
```bash
poetry run pytest --cache-clear
```

### Run specific test file
```bash
poetry run pytest tests/routers/test_async_endpoints.py
```

After running the test suite, detailed reports will be generated in the following locations:

- `report/pytest/index.html`: Interactive HTML report showing test results, including:
  - Test case execution summary
  - Pass/fail statistics
  - Detailed error messages and tracebacks
  - Test execution time

- `report/coverage/index.html`: Comprehensive code coverage report containing:
  - Overall coverage percentage
  - File-by-file coverage analysis
  - Line-by-line coverage highlighting
  - Missing coverage identification

You can open these HTML reports in any web browser for a detailed view of test results and coverage analysis.

Example reports are available in the repository:
- [Example Pytest Report](media/example_pytest_report/index.html): See a sample of the test execution report
- [Example Coverage Report](media/example_coverage_report/index.html): View a sample code coverage analysis
